### R1D62 & R1D63

### R1D65 & D66
After being under the weather,
I only came to some reading

continued working on the
@freeCodeCamp Project
"D3 Scatterplot Graph" from
"Data Visualization with D3".

### R1D69
* did a lot of reading, but not
  as fallback, but by intention ^^.
  Doing #JS vs. #PHP vs. #Python
  for my @freeCodeCamp "Front End
  Libraries Certification" Project
  "Technical Documentation Page"
  Do you know, what ?...$val means
  in #PHP? Read about it in my
  Project (to become Blog-Post ; ).

### R1D70
After @ka11ways talk at #byteconf,
I'm gonna heed his words and
won't reset the challenge,
but try to get back on track
on Monday (at the latest ; ).
Today I only stayed tuned in
on @byteconf and definitely
catch up their other talks
on YouTube!

### R1D71
As promised I returned to the
challenge and continued working
on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
but it's rather turning into a
full scale blog post ^^. 1/2

2/2 All while trying an
update to Mint 19 on my
Dev-@TUXEDOComputers
Laptop, with a first for me:
the Ethernet Card won't work,
while WiFi worked out
of the box % ).
(Probs with an RT8111/8168,
but I'm gonna get it running! ; )

### R1D72P1
After fixing the Problems
with the RT8111/8168 (see
R1/D71) in Mint 19, I dived
into the intestines of
systemd-resolved.
Hoped to get it running
with my old local .test
confs for nginx and
uWSGI #Python, but had to
disable it % |.
Now some coding ^^.

### R1D72P2
Finally coding, I continued
working on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page".
Implemented the start of
a Pure-CSS Burger-Menu,
using :target Pseudo-Element
and added line numbering to
code elements.

### R1D73
* "Finished" the Pure-CSS
  Burger-Menu via :target
  (have to tweak anims ; )
  Added PHP variables and
  tests are now all passing
  for the @freeCodeCamp
  Project "Technical
  Documentation Page".
* Finally came to watching
  more of @byteconf on YT.
// Left Testing Big with BigTest in React 11:49

### R1D74
Been a while for me
writing bash scripts,
so wrote one to ease
backing up client's server
and local Dev instances.
Continued @freeCodeCamp
Project "Technical
Documentation Page"
It's now nearly as long
as their example, and
now just covers vars
and types...

### R1D75
Still continuing with my
@freeCodeCamp Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
and now threw #Python in
the variable comparison part
and enhanced some examples.
But take a sneak peek below : ).
25 days left to go!
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 75%

### R1D76
Speaking with @MBrazeilles
from @mjmlio (kudos again ; )
spurred my ambition and
I looked into their App and
MJML 4.
Found a quirk with Migrating
my signature from V3 but will
try to solve it myself
before opening an issue
(might be my machine : ).

### R1D77 + R1D78
Took a day off on Sunday, as
we were at @BuskersWien
Street Art Festival and got
into the After Party % ).
So yesterday dived into
mjmlio-app's migrate code and
read some info about finite
state machines in #reactjs.

### R1D79
Looked further into the code
of mjml and IntelliJ Idea
nearly crashed while indexing,
after installation of that many
(recursive) node_modules with
"yarn" within the packages folder ^^.
Problem solved, no worries...

### R1D80
After getting NodeJS debugging
running in Idea, I looked into
my mjml problem.
Switched to and fro
my @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page".
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 80%
Oh, and:
Happy #InternationalProgrammersDay!
But my wife put it way better:
https://twitter.com/ninahagn/status/1040272691444547584

### R1D81
My MJML-debugging was "useless",
migrate-probs arose through
html-comments...
More of @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page", feels
like I'm writing a book ; ).
And I found a "gem" of my
#Pascal days from the 90's,
will try pushing it to a repo
on the weekend % ).
Oh, and I watched more of @byteconf,
only one vid left to go...
And of course @NikkitaFTW's vid : ).

### R1D82
Went down memory lane today,
found my old Turbo Pascal 6.0
and installed it in DosBox
- only to sadly realize,
some TPUs (precompiled TP
Units, today might be
classes ; ) for the game
I wrote are missing : (.
Trying to find them online,
but to no avail...

Oh, maybe they are missing because
I now have 404 followers *lol*?
Thnx to all of you anyways : )!

### R1D83
Still recuperating from landing
at a Party in a squatted house
nearby together and returning
home Sunday after sunrise.
Only managed research for
the Book I got the TPUs from
and finally found it:
PC Underground of Publisher
Data Becker (R.I.P ; )

### R1D84
Found attached English
CD-ROM to the #Pascal & #TASM
book online & started tinkering
to get it to compile in TP6...
But read for yourself in the repos
to the game with a little history
sprinkled on top : ).

### R1D84 (addendum)
Started @freeCodeCamp's "Apis And
Microservices Certification",
finished "Managing Packages with
npm Challenges".

### R1D85
Continued my @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page", started their
"Apis And Microservices
Certification" finishing
"Managing Packages with
npm Challenges" and starting
"Basic Node and Express
Challenges"- to clear my
head of #Pascal ; ).
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 85%

### R1D86
Started'n'finished "Node and
Express" of "Apis And
Microservices" Cert.
But @glitch just doesn't fit
my usual @nodejs workflow...
Afterwards productive meeting
with my designer-wife @ninahagn;
talked and decided about my new
Profile-/Homepage design.

### R1/D--
Didn't code today, was out last night till 4am % ).  
But I've an important question for you,  
please vote & RT  
(Leave a comment for other ideas.  
Frontend will be #reactjs : )!

Which Backend should I use  
for my new Profile / Homepage?   
(\* is new for me)   

10 Votes:  
00% Stick with Drupal  
10% WordPress (don't like ; )  
20% Try Flask / Django \*  
70% node.js (GatsbyJS? \*)

### R1D87 (split)
As on the weekend I only
researched bout @gatsbyjs
& #VPS vs. #PaaS for #NodeJS
hosting, I'm only gonna
count it as one day.
But we bought & solved two
puzzle-cubes from the
"Museum of Illusions" - does
that count as "hardcoding" ; )?

### R1D88
Tinkered with @gatsbyjs  
& played around with
styled-components and such.
Got a little bugged by
my current hosting
not providing #NodeJS...

Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Timestamp Microservice Project
as a cooldown... % )

Why do you want both a #github
repo and #glitch link _both_ to be
able to complete the Project oO?

### R1D89
Couldn't code much today,
as a fruitful meeting with
my Designer-Wife @ninahagn
took place : ).
Then we resealed our windows,
temps are dropping -.-
But I at least finished
@freeCodeCamp's Header Parser
Microservice Project ; ).

### R1D90
Went through the @freeCodeCamp
MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges,
but if I hadn't known #MongoDB
before, I might have been stumped.
Maybe should finally contribute % ).
Finished the URL Shortener
Microservice Project afterwards : ).

I used my URL shortener for the above link, but twitter linked through % ). Link on Glitch: https://th-fcc-su.glitch.me/  And I forgot to add: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%

### R1D91
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Exercise Tracker Microservice
Project after failing to get
razzle running on @glitch,
then stumbling over CRA
on it (kudos!) and playing
around with GatsbyJS on
@codesandboxapp : ).

And here it is on glitch: https://th-fcc-exercise.glitch.me/
Did I say, that I like async ... await functions?
I like async ... await functions ^^.

### R1D92 (part 1)
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"File Metadata Microservice"
Project and got me my
"APIs and Microservices Certificate",
that's makes it a triple : ).
As I needed less than half
an hour for it, that won't
be all for today, so stay tuned!

### R1D92 (part 2)
As said before, while I did
@freeCodeCamp's MongoDB
challenges and projects,
I was a little annoyed at times
by warnings and errors with
outdated packages.
So I just opened my first PR to the Repo.
Wish me luck : ).
