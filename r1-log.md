  as fallback, but by intention ^^.
  Doing #JS vs. #PHP vs. #Python
  for my @freeCodeCamp "Front End
  Libraries Certification" Project
  "Technical Documentation Page"
  Do you know, what ?...$val means
  in #PHP? Read about it in my
  Project (to become Blog-Post ; ).

### R1D70
After @ka11ways talk at #byteconf,
I'm gonna heed his words and
won't reset the challenge,
but try to get back on track
on Monday (at the latest ; ).
Today I only stayed tuned in
on @byteconf and definitely
catch up their other talks
on YouTube!

### R1D71
As promised I returned to the
challenge and continued working
on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
but it's rather turning into a
full scale blog post ^^. 1/2

2/2 All while trying an
update to Mint 19 on my
Dev-@TUXEDOComputers
Laptop, with a first for me:
the Ethernet Card won't work,
while WiFi worked out
of the box % ).
(Probs with an RT8111/8168,
but I'm gonna get it running! ; )

### R1D72P1
After fixing the Problems
with the RT8111/8168 (see
R1/D71) in Mint 19, I dived
into the intestines of
systemd-resolved.
Hoped to get it running
with my old local .test
confs for nginx and
uWSGI #Python, but had to
disable it % |.
Now some coding ^^.

### R1D72P2
Finally coding, I continued
working on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page".
Implemented the start of
a Pure-CSS Burger-Menu,
using :target Pseudo-Element
and added line numbering to
code elements.

### R1D73
* "Finished" the Pure-CSS
  Burger-Menu via :target
  (have to tweak anims ; )
  Added PHP variables and
  tests are now all passing
  for the @freeCodeCamp
  Project "Technical
  Documentation Page".
* Finally came to watching
  more of @byteconf on YT.
// Left Testing Big with BigTest in React 11:49

### R1D74
Been a while for me
writing bash scripts,
so wrote one to ease
backing up client's server
and local Dev instances.
Continued @freeCodeCamp
Project "Technical
Documentation Page"
It's now nearly as long
as their example, and
now just covers vars
and types...

### R1D75
Still continuing with my
@freeCodeCamp Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
and now threw #Python in
the variable comparison part
and enhanced some examples.
But take a sneak peek below : ).
25 days left to go!
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 75%

### R1D76
Speaking with @MBrazeilles
from @mjmlio (kudos again ; )
spurred my ambition and
I looked into their App and
MJML 4.
Found a quirk with Migrating
my signature from V3 but will
try to solve it myself
before opening an issue
(might be my machine : ).

### R1D77 + R1D78
Took a day off on Sunday, as
we were at @BuskersWien
Street Art Festival and got
into the After Party % ).
So yesterday dived into
mjmlio-app's migrate code and
read some info about finite
state machines in #reactjs.

### R1D79
Looked further into the code
of mjml and IntelliJ Idea
nearly crashed while indexing,
after installation of that many
(recursive) node_modules with
"yarn" within the packages folder ^^.
Problem solved, no worries...

### R1D80
After getting NodeJS debugging
running in Idea, I looked into
my mjml problem.
Switched to and fro
my @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page".
