### R1D61
* finished @freeCodeCamp Project
  "D3 Bar Chart" from "Data
  Visualization with D3"

### R1D62 & R1D63
On Wednesday I only came to reading
bout #Python again (after all it was
a bank holiday here ; ).
Yesterday I started the @freeCodeCamp
Project "D3 Scatterplot Graph" from
"Data Visualization with D3".

### R1D64
* continued working on the
  @freeCodeCamp Project
  "D3 Scatterplot Graph" from
  "Data Visualization with D3".

### R1D65 & D66
After being under the weather,
I only came to some reading
about #Python and #reactjs on
Saturday and took the day off
on Sunday. Today I at least
continued working on the
@freeCodeCamp Project
"D3 Scatterplot Graph" from
"Data Visualization with D3".

### R1D67
Feeling slightly better, so
* finally finished @freeCodeCamp
  Project "D3 Scatterplot Graph"

  "Data Visualization with D3"
  and mirrored them on BitBucket
* started @freeCodeCamp "Front End
  Libraries Certification" Project

### R1D69
* did a lot of reading, but not
  as fallback, but by intention ^^.
  Doing #JS vs. #PHP vs. #Python
  for my @freeCodeCamp "Front End
  Libraries Certification" Project
  "Technical Documentation Page"
  Do you know, what ?...$val means
  in #PHP? Read about it in my
  Project (to become Blog-Post ; ).

### R1D70
After @ka11ways talk at #byteconf,
I'm gonna heed his words and
won't reset the challenge,
but try to get back on track
on Monday (at the latest ; ).
Today I only stayed tuned in
on @byteconf and definitely
catch up their other talks
on YouTube!

### R1D71
As promised I returned to the
challenge and continued working
on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
but it's rather turning into a
full scale blog post ^^. 1/2

2/2 All while trying an
update to Mint 19 on my
Dev-@TUXEDOComputers
Laptop, with a first for me:
the Ethernet Card won't work,
while WiFi worked out
of the box % ).
(Probs with an RT8111/8168,
but I'm gonna get it running! ; )

### R1D72P1
After fixing the Problems
with the RT8111/8168 (see
R1/D71) in Mint 19, I dived
into the intestines of
systemd-resolved.
Hoped to get it running
with my old local .test
confs for nginx and
uWSGI #Python, but had to
disable it % |.
Now some coding ^^.

### R1D72P2
Finally coding, I continued
working on my @freeCodeCamp
"Responsive Web Design
Certification" Project
"Technical Documentation Page".
Implemented the start of
a Pure-CSS Burger-Menu,
using :target Pseudo-Element
and added line numbering to
code elements.

### R1D73
* "Finished" the Pure-CSS
  Burger-Menu via :target
  (have to tweak anims ; )
  Added PHP variables and
  tests are now all passing
  for the @freeCodeCamp
  Project "Technical
  Documentation Page".
* Finally came to watching
  more of @byteconf on YT.
// Left Testing Big with BigTest in React 11:49

### R1D74
Been a while for me
writing bash scripts,
so wrote one to ease
backing up client's server
and local Dev instances.
Continued @freeCodeCamp
Project "Technical
Documentation Page"
It's now nearly as long
as their example, and
now just covers vars
and types...

### R1D75
Still continuing with my
@freeCodeCamp Project
"Technical Documentation Page"
and now threw #Python in
the variable comparison part
and enhanced some examples.
But take a sneak peek below : ).
25 days left to go!
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 75%

### R1D76
Speaking with @MBrazeilles
from @mjmlio (kudos again ; )
spurred my ambition and
I looked into their App and
MJML 4.
Found a quirk with Migrating
my signature from V3 but will
try to solve it myself
before opening an issue
(might be my machine : ).

### R1D77 + R1D78
Took a day off on Sunday, as
we were at @BuskersWien
Street Art Festival and got
into the After Party % ).
So yesterday dived into
mjmlio-app's migrate code and
read some info about finite
state machines in #reactjs.

### R1D79
Looked further into the code
of mjml and IntelliJ Idea
nearly crashed while indexing,
after installation of that many
(recursive) node_modules with
"yarn" within the packages folder ^^.
Problem solved, no worries...

### R1D80
After getting NodeJS debugging
running in Idea, I looked into
my mjml problem.
Switched to and fro
my @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page".
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 80%
Oh, and:
Happy #InternationalProgrammersDay!
But my wife put it way better:
https://twitter.com/ninahagn/status/1040272691444547584

### R1D81
My MJML-debugging was "useless",
migrate-probs arose through
html-comments...
More of @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page", feels
like I'm writing a book ; ).
And I found a "gem" of my
#Pascal days from the 90's,
will try pushing it to a repo
on the weekend % ).
Oh, and I watched more of @byteconf,
only one vid left to go...
And of course @NikkitaFTW's vid : ).

### R1D82
Went down memory lane today,
found my old Turbo Pascal 6.0
and installed it in DosBox
- only to sadly realize,
some TPUs (precompiled TP
Units, today might be
classes ; ) for the game
I wrote are missing : (.
Trying to find them online,
but to no avail...

Oh, maybe they are missing because
I now have 404 followers *lol*?
Thnx to all of you anyways : )!

### R1D83
Still recuperating from landing
at a Party in a squatted house
nearby together and returning
home Sunday after sunrise.
Only managed research for
the Book I got the TPUs from
and finally found it:
PC Underground of Publisher
Data Becker (R.I.P ; )

### R1D84
Found attached English
CD-ROM to the #Pascal & #TASM
book online & started tinkering
to get it to compile in TP6...
But read for yourself in the repos
to the game with a little history
sprinkled on top : ).

### R1D84 (addendum)
Started @freeCodeCamp's "Apis And
Microservices Certification",
finished "Managing Packages with
npm Challenges".

### R1D85
Continued my @freeCodeCamp
"Tech Doc Page", started their
"Apis And Microservices
Certification" finishing
"Managing Packages with
npm Challenges" and starting
"Basic Node and Express
Challenges"- to clear my
head of #Pascal ; ).
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 85%

### R1D86
Started'n'finished "Node and
Express" of "Apis And
Microservices" Cert.
But @glitch just doesn't fit
my usual @nodejs workflow...
Afterwards productive meeting
with my designer-wife @ninahagn;
talked and decided about my new
Profile-/Homepage design.

### R1/D--
Didn't code today, was out last night till 4am % ).  
But I've an important question for you,  
please vote & RT  
(Leave a comment for other ideas.  
Frontend will be #reactjs : )!

Which Backend should I use  
for my new Profile / Homepage?   
(\* is new for me)   

10 Votes:  
00% Stick with Drupal  
10% WordPress (don't like ; )  
20% Try Flask / Django \*  
70% node.js (GatsbyJS? \*)

### R1D87 (split)
As on the weekend I only
researched bout @gatsbyjs
& #VPS vs. #PaaS for #NodeJS
hosting, I'm only gonna
count it as one day.
But we bought & solved two
puzzle-cubes from the
"Museum of Illusions" - does
that count as "hardcoding" ; )?

### R1D88
Tinkered with @gatsbyjs  
& played around with
styled-components and such.
Got a little bugged by
my current hosting
not providing #NodeJS...

Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Timestamp Microservice Project
as a cooldown... % )

Why do you want both a #github
repo and #glitch link _both_ to be
able to complete the Project oO?

### R1D89
Couldn't code much today,
as a fruitful meeting with
my Designer-Wife @ninahagn
took place : ).
Then we resealed our windows,
temps are dropping -.-
But I at least finished
@freeCodeCamp's Header Parser
Microservice Project ; ).

### R1D90
Went through the @freeCodeCamp
MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges,
but if I hadn't known #MongoDB
before, I might have been stumped.
Maybe should finally contribute % ).
Finished the URL Shortener
Microservice Project afterwards : ).

I used my URL shortener for the above link, but twitter linked through % ). Link on Glitch: https://th-fcc-su.glitch.me/  And I forgot to add: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%

### R1D91
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Exercise Tracker Microservice
Project after failing to get
razzle running on @glitch,
then stumbling over CRA
on it (kudos!) and playing
around with GatsbyJS on
@codesandboxapp : ).

And here it is on glitch: https://th-fcc-exercise.glitch.me/
Did I say, that I like async ... await functions?
I like async ... await functions ^^.

### R1D92 (part 1)
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"File Metadata Microservice"
Project and got me my
"APIs and Microservices Certificate",
that's makes it a triple : ).
As I needed less than half
an hour for it, that won't
be all for today, so stay tuned!

### R1D92 (part 2)
As said before, while I did
@freeCodeCamp's MongoDB
challenges and projects,
I was a little annoyed at times
by warnings and errors with
outdated packages.
So I just opened my first PR to the Repo.
Wish me luck : ).
https://tinyurl.com/th-fcc-pr

### R1D93
Having coded nothing on the
weekend (needed a break after
last week % ), I jumped straight
back in and finally finished
@freeCodeCamp's "Heat Map" Project.
Afterwards finished the
"Choropleth Map", which seemed
easier than the first (except
D3.js v5 % ).

### R1D94
The last Project of @freeCodeCamp's
"Data Visualization Certification"
was harder than the one before
(too many examples still use D3.js v4
or even v3 - but I went with v5 % ).
But got me my certificate, that's
a quadruple now : ).

### R1D94 (part 2)
Started and finished "Introduction
to Information Security with
HelmetJS Challenges".

### R1D95 (part 1)
Started #hacktoberfest with two PRs
to @freeCodeCamp's InfoSec Course's
"HelmetJS" & "bcrypt" challenges.

### R1D95 (part 2)
Was getting eager for #hacktoberfest,
so on to the hunt for a few candidates.
Afterwards, I managed to squeeze a
few commits to my @freeCodeCamp's
"TecDoc Page" in.
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 95%

### R1D96 (part 1?)
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"QA with Chai Challenges".
Afterwards I adapted the
functional tests in it's  
boilerplate Repo to newer
zombie behavior and
created (another %) PR...

### R1D97
After taking another break
over the weekend and doing
client-work yesterday,
I jumped back into @freeCodeCamp
and finished 13 of the 22
"Advances Node and Express
Challenges" with authentication.

### R1D98
Finished the rest of @freeCodeCamp's
"Advances Node and Express
Challenges" (and definitely will
have to do a PR, they are buggy ; ).
Afterwards did the Project
"Metric-Imperial Converter"
and "relaxed" with 2 of
Project Euler algos.

### R1D99
1/3
Of course it was a bad idea
to get back into the challenge
after more than a 24h of
sleeplessness, but still managed
to finish @freeCodeCamp's
"Issue Tracker Project" in way
too much time: ~2h til the tests
were all showing green - but
wait for it:

2/3
Later over 4 more hours of
debugging caused by a switched
key / value pair -.-

And I didn't post any updates,
cause I was feeling under the
weather with partially self-imposed
ailment for the last week where
I just got to some reading and
too many thoughts and ideas...

3/3
...bad ones of both kind, I just
can't count for the challenge % |.

But on to a final sprint ^^!

Here's the Issue Tracker:
GitHub: https://github.com/timhagn/th-fcc-issue
Glitch: https://th-fcc-issue.glitch.me/

### R1D100
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 100%
On my last day of the Challenge
I binge-programmed through the
last three @freeCodeCamp ISC-Projects
and got my fifth Certificate : ).
P.S.: I'm thinking bout giving
me a penalty, but more on it
tomorrow, am completely burnt % ).

### R1D100 + P1+2
Thnx for your kindness!
I completely forgot to tell you,
that I'm already in my penalty ^^.
Yesterday I did a PR to
"styled-media-queries", bumping
it to styled-components 4
and Babel 7. Today I wrote
the first tests in jest for it : ).
#Hacktoberfest

### R1D100 + P3
As I had to go to the German consulate
today to get my ID renewed and apply
for a passport, I just managed to give
me a quick intro to react-test-renderer &
jest-styled-components, try to write
some tests with them and... fail % ).
#Hacktoberfest2018

### R1D100 + P4
Today I finished writing the tests
while getting myself an intro to
jest-styled-components.
With finishing this PR, I reached
my goal for #Hacktoberfest : ).
https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/timhagn

### R1D100 + P5
Started @freeCodeCamp's "Personal
Portfolio Webpage" Project. Trying
it with Drupal as Backend and
Gatsby as Frontend, but ran into
Permission problems on my hosting -.-

### R1D100 + P6 (part 1)
Yesterday's Problem didn't arise
through Drupal permissions, but
rather through DDOS prevention
on my hosting. I therefore created
a PR with a rateLimit for
gatsby-source-drupal : ).
#Hacktoberfest
Am coding on ^^.

### R1D100 + P6 (part 2)
After the PR was done and Gatsby
working with Drupal, I continued
working on @freeCodeCamp's
"Personal Portfolio Webpage" Project.
8 of 12 tests are passing and I'm  
getting comfy with GraphQL : ).

### R1D100 + P7
Happy ol' hallow's eve, everyone ^^!
#HappyHalloween
I continued working on @freeCodeCamp's
"Personal Portfolio Webpage" Project.
Now all tests are passing, but still
got much to do (especially getting
the Projects from Drupal).

### R1D100 + P8
In the aftermath (I like this word ; )
of Hallow's eve, I only managed to
fix some styles and finish my NavBar.
More in the morrow ^^.

### R1D100 + P9
Felt under the weather this week
and down with some sickness.
Only managed to help a few newbies,
(I hope so ; ).
Today I struggled for ~10h with
Gatsby and dependency hell cause
of a well meant change to my PR
to it - but up and running, again : ).

Yeah, maybe I should restart my
penalty, but feeling penalized enough
as it is % )...
What do you think?

### R1D100 + P10
Continued working on my Portfolio
Page (yup, still @freeCodeCamp ; ),
sitting at the Projects Part (last
one) and getting the hang about
mixing #Drupal & #Gatsby : ).

### R1D100 + P11
As I was annoyed with existing
workarounds to use the amazing
"gatsby-image" as a background
image, I salvaged it to start a
"gatsby-background-image"
component using CSS ^^.
Hope to be able to release to the
wild next week, stay tuned : ).

### R1D100 + P12 & 13
Completely forgot to post yesterday,
cause after proggin, there was
(kitchen deep) cleaning.
Finally finished my Portfolio Page,
added a 404 today and "only" have
to replace the dummy content with
the real thing tomorrow : ).

### R1D100 + P14 & 15
Didn't forget to tweet, just couldn't
account for "real coding".
Wrote text for the site, looked
into an Android App for an aquaintance
and refactored a little...
Can anyone explain to me, why the
backgroundStyles won't be set?

### R1D100 + P--
On Saturday I thought I failed a quite long
assessment test - but seems I didn't % ).
But, alas, my main workstation's Motherboard
suddenly stopped working yesterday,
that's why I didn't post -.-
Hope to get back up and running this week...

### R1D100 + P16
Replaced my main workstation with
my Dev-Laptop for the moment.
Had to attend a "coding interview"
in the afternoon for ~2h, and
I don't know if I nailed or failed,
feeling like the latter -.-
But we gotta see, what we gotta see...
#braindead now...

### R1D100 + P17
Can't believe the interview did
in fact go well, after all % ).
Got up and... uhm... limping again
and at least managed to continue
with my Portfolio Page (some errors
like 404 & favicons still remaining... ; ).
First audit (on server):
![Portfolio Audit](imgs/th-audit.jpg)

### R1D100 + P18
Got stuck with HTML normalization
today while writing and receiving
texts from the #Drupal backend.
And yup (don't hit me) I even tried
RegEx % ). Why isn't there a _simple_
alternative for DOMParser in @nodejs?
Or did I miss something in @Gatsby?

### R1D100 + P19
Sidetracked myself from the portfolio
with creating a React Component for
automated mocking up of Screenshots
to be realized as a @npmjs & #Drupal
module later on (was dissatisfied
with my project images ; ).
Only fixed some grid CSS on the site...

### R1D100 + P20
Took today "slowly" and "only" worked
on updating my PRs to "styled-media-query",
two @freeCodeCamp boilerplates
(@ossia will they ever get merged? ; )
and updated "MockMe" with choose-able
mock images. Also started preparing
it for usage as a #Drupal Module : ).

### R1D100 + P21
Worked for only 3h33m till now,
but hey, it's Sunday ; ).
Now you can grab external Screenshots
with MockMe, a.t.m. through the sadly
discontinued PhantomJS. Integrated
back end with composer and wrote
first steps of a #Drupal integration : ).

### R1D100 + P22,23,24,25
Didn't stop working the last
four Days, just was to groggy
after it to post ^^.
Still on my "MockMe" Sidetrack,
meanwhile it's integrated in
Drupal, I just have to switch
the Widget for a Preview...
Is this procrastination % )?

### R1D100 + P26
Finally it's working! Below, I "proudly"
present the first version of
"Mockme Widget" for @Drupal : ).
Grab it at
https://github.com/timhagn/mockme
Now back to the Portfolio Page
to at last get that one finished, too % ).

### R1D100 + P27
Although I did work over the weekend,
I'd only count it as one day.
Haven't done enough, to do otherwise ; ).
Some tweaking and integration.
Now on to more : )!

### R1D100 + P28
Soon there won't be screenshots,
but links, I promise % ).
Continued on my @freeCodeCamp
Portfolio Page, added more Projects
and a "load more" Button.
Tweaked MockMe as well,
don't ya think ; ).

###R1D100 + P29
Took it slowly the last two days,
as I wasn't feeling so well.
Still managed to work on my page,
"show more" is working and I'm
nearly finished. These are the
latest audits - the last % I'm
gonna squeeze out, too ; ).
