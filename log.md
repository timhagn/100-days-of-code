Why do you want both a #github
repo and #glitch link _both_ to be
able to complete the Project oO?

### Day 89, September 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Couldn't code much today,
as a fruitful meeting with
my Designer-Wife @ninahagn
took place : ).
Then we resealed our windows,
temps are dropping -.-
But I at least finished
@freeCodeCamp's Header Parser
Microservice Project ; ).

### Day 90, September 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Went through the @freeCodeCamp
MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges,
but if I hadn't known #MongoDB
before, I might have been stumped.
Maybe should finally contribute % ).
Finished the URL Shortener
Microservice Project afterwards : ).

I used my URL shortener for the above link, but twitter linked through % ). Link on Glitch: https://th-fcc-su.glitch.me/  And I forgot to add: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%

### Day 91, September 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Exercise Tracker Microservice
Project after failing to get
razzle running on @glitch,
then stumbling over CRA
on it (kudos!) and playing
around with GatsbyJS on
@codesandboxapp : ).

And here it is on glitch: https://th-fcc-exercise.glitch.me/

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 1)

**Today's Progress (so far)**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"File Metadata Microservice"
Project and got me my
"APIs and Microservices Certificate",
that's makes it a triple : ).
As I needed less than half
an hour for it, that won't
be all for today, so stay tuned!

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 2)

**Today's (further) Progress**
As said before, while I did
@freeCodeCamp's MongoDB
challenges and projects,
I was a little annoyed at times
by warnings and errors with
outdated packages.
So I just opened my first PR to the Repo.
Wish me luck : ).

### Day 93, October 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Having coded nothing on the
weekend (needed a break after
last week % ), I jumped straight
back in and finally finished
@freeCodeCamp's "Heat Map" Project.
Afterwards finished the
"Choropleth Map", which seemed
easier than the first (except
D3.js v5 % ).

### Day 94, October 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
The last Project of @freeCodeCamp's
"Data Visualization Certification"
was harder than the one before
(too many examples still use D3.js v4
or even v3 - but I went with v5 % ).
But got me my certificate, that's
a quadruple now : ).

▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 95%



### Day 96, October 5, Friday (part 1?)

Project Euler algos.

### Day 99, October 19, Friday

**Today's "Progress"**
1/3
Of course it was a bad idea
to get back into the challenge
after more than a 24h of
sleeplessness, but still managed
to finish @freeCodeCamp's
"Issue Tracker Project" in way
too much time: ~2h til the tests
were all showing green - but
wait for it:

2/3
Later over 4 more hours of
debugging caused by a switched
key / value pair -.-

And I didn't post any updates,
cause I was feeling under the
weather with partially self-imposed
ailment for the last week where
I just got to some reading and
too many thoughts and ideas...

3/3
...bad ones of both kind, I just
can't count for the challenge % |.

But on to a final sprint ^^!

**Today's Progress**
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 100%
On my last day of the Challenge
I binge-programmed through the
last three @freeCodeCamp ISC-Projects
and got my fifth Certificate : ).
P.S.: I'm thinking bout giving
me a penalty, but more on it
tomorrow, am completely burnt % ).

### Day 100 + 1 & 2, October 23, Tuesday & October 24, Wednesday

**Twoday's Progress**
Thnx for your kindness!
I completely forgot to tell you,
that I'm already in my penalty ^^.
Yesterday I did a PR to
"styled-media-queries", bumping
it to styled-components 4
and Babel 7. Today I wrote
the first tests in jest for it : ).
#Hacktoberfest



### Day 100 + 3, October 25, Thursday

**Today's "Progress"**
As I had to go to the German consulate
today to get my ID renewed and apply
for a passport, I just managed to give
me a quick intro to react-test-renderer &
jest-styled-components, try to write
some tests with them and... fail % ).
#Hacktoberfest2018



### Day 100 + 4, October 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Today I finished writing the tests
while getting myself an intro to
jest-styled-components.
With finishing this PR, I reached
my goal for #Hacktoberfest : ).
#Hacktoberfest2018

### Day 100 + 5, October 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**
Started @freeCodeCamp's "Personal
Portfolio Webpage" Project. Trying
it with Drupal as Backend and
Gatsby as Frontend, but ran into
Permission problems on my hosting -.-

**Image(s) to "Work"**
1. [Portfolio Backend](imgs/portfolio-backend.jpg)



### Day 100 + 6, October 30, Tuesday (part 1)

**Today's Progress**
Yesterday's Problem didn't arise
through Drupal permissions, but
rather through DDOS prevention
on my hosting. I therefore created
a PR with a rateLimit for
gatsby-source-drupal : ).
#Hacktoberfest
Am coding on ^^.



### Day 100 + 6, October 30, Tuesday (part 2)

**Today's further Progress**
After the PR was done and Gatsby
working with Drupal, I continued
working on @freeCodeCamp's
"Personal Portfolio Webpage" Project.
8 of 12 tests are passing and I'm  
getting comfy with GraphQL : ).



### Day 100 + 7, October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Happy ol' hallow's eve, everyone ^^!
#HappyHalloween
I continued working on @freeCodeCamp's
"Personal Portfolio Webpage" Project.
Now all tests are passing, but still
got much to do (especially getting
the Projects from Drupal).



### Day 100 + 8, November 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
In the aftermath (I like this word ; )
of Hallow's eve, I only managed to
fix some styles and finish my NavBar.
More in the morrow ^^.



### Day 100 + 9, November 9, Friday

**Last week's & Today's "Progress"**
Felt under the weather this week
and down with some sickness.
Only managed to help a few newbies,
(I hope so ; ).
Today I struggled for ~10h with
Gatsby and dependency hell cause
of a well meant change to my PR
to it - but up and running, again : ).

Yeah, maybe I should restart my
penalty, but feeling penalized enough
as it is % )...
What do you think?


### Day 100 + 10, November 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
Continued working on my Portfolio
Page (yup, still @freeCodeCamp ; ),
sitting at the Projects Part (last
one) and getting the hang about
mixing #Drupal & #Gatsby : ).



### Day 100 + 11, November 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
As I was annoyed with existing
workarounds to use the amazing
"gatsby-image" as a background
image, I salvaged it to start a
"gatsby-background-image"
component using CSS ^^.
Hope to be able to release to the
wild next week, stay tuned : ).

### Day 100 + 12 & 13, November 12, Monday + November 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Completely forgot to post yesterday,
cause after proggin, there was
(kitchen deep) cleaning.
Finally finished my Portfolio Page,
added a 404 today and "only" have
to replace the dummy content with
the real thing tomorrow : ).

### Day 100 + 14 & 15, November 14 - 16

**Threeday's Progress**
Didn't forget to tweet, just couldn't
account for "real coding".
Wrote text for the site, looked
into an Android App for an aquaintance
and refactored a little...
Can anyone explain to me, why the
backgroundStyles won't be set?

### Day 100 + P--

**Threeday's Progress**
On Saturday I thought I failed a quite long
assessment test - but seems I didn't % ).
But, alas, my main workstation's Motherboard
suddenly stopped working yesterday,
that's why I didn't post -.-
Hope to get back up and running this week...



### Day 100 + 16, November 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Replaced my main workstation with
my Dev-Laptop for the moment.
Had to attend a "coding interview"
in the afternoon for ~2h, and
I don't know if I nailed or failed,
feeling like the latter -.-
But we gotta see, what we gotta see...
#braindead now...



### Day 100 + 17, November 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Can't believe the interview did
in fact go well, after all % ).
Got up and... uhm... limping again
and at least managed to continue
with my Portfolio Page (some errors
like 404 & favicons still remaining... ; ).
First audit (on server):

**Image(s) to "Work"**
1. [Portfolio Audit](imgs/th-audit.jpg)



### Day 100 + 18, November 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Got stuck with HTML normalization
today while writing and receiving
texts from the #Drupal backend.
And yup (don't hit me) I even tried
RegEx % ). Why isn't there a _simple_
alternative for DOMParser in @nodejs?
Or did I miss something in @Gatsby?



### Day 100 + 19, November 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Sidetracked myself from the portfolio
with creating a React Component for
automated mocking up of Screenshots
to be realized as a @npmjs & #Drupal
module later on (was dissatisfied
with my project images ; ).
Only fixed some grid CSS on the site...

**Image(s) to "Work"**

### Day 100 + 20, November 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**
Took today "slowly" and "only" worked
on updating my PRs to "styled-media-query",
two @freeCodeCamp boilerplates
(@ossia will they ever get merged? ; )
and updated "MockMe" with choose-able
mock images. Also started preparing
it for usage as a #Drupal Module : ).

### Day 100 + 21, November 25, Sunday

**Today's Progress**
Worked for only 3h33m till now,
but hey, it's Sunday ; ).
Now you can grab external Screenshots
with MockMe, a.t.m. through the sadly
discontinued PhantomJS. Integrated
back end with composer and wrote
first steps of a #Drupal integration : ).

### Day 100 + 22,23,24,25, November 26, Thursday - November 29, Thursday

**Fourday's Progress**
Didn't stop working the last
four Days, just was to groggy
after it to post ^^.
Still on my "MockMe" Sidetrack,
meanwhile it's integrated in
Drupal, I just have to switch
the Widget for a Preview...
Is this procrastination % )?

### Day 100 + 26, November 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**
Finally it's working! Below, I "proudly"
present the first version of
"Mockme Widget" for @Drupal : ).
Grab it at
https://github.com/timhagn/mockme
Now back to the Portfolio Page
to at last get that one finished, too % ).

### Day 100 + 27, December 1 + 2, Saturday & Sunday

**Twoday's Progress**
Although I did work over the weekend,
I'd only count it as one day.
Haven't done enough, to do otherwise ; ).
Some tweaking and integration.
Now on to more : )!



### Day 100 + 28, December 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**
Soon there won't be screenshots,
but links, I promise % ).
Continued on my @freeCodeCamp
Portfolio Page, added more Projects
and a "load more" Button.
Tweaked MockMe as well,
don't ya think ; ).

### Day 100 + 29, December 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Took it slowly the last two days,
as I wasn't feeling so well.
Still managed to work on my page,
"show more" is working and I'm
nearly finished. These are the
latest audits - I'm gonna squeeze out
the last %s, too ; ).

Although I was "lazy" pertaining
tweets, I worked as hell the last
week to finally finish
@freeCodeCamp's Curriculum.
Today I published
'gatsby-background-image',

remaining certs : )!
