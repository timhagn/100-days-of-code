Why do you want both a #github
repo and #glitch link _both_ to be
able to complete the Project oO?

### Day 89, September 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Couldn't code much today,
as a fruitful meeting with
my Designer-Wife @ninahagn
took place : ).
Then we resealed our windows,
temps are dropping -.-
But I at least finished
@freeCodeCamp's Header Parser
Microservice Project ; ).

### Day 90, September 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Went through the @freeCodeCamp
MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges,
but if I hadn't known #MongoDB
before, I might have been stumped.
Maybe should finally contribute % ).
Finished the URL Shortener
Microservice Project afterwards : ).

I used my URL shortener for the above link, but twitter linked through % ). Link on Glitch: https://th-fcc-su.glitch.me/  And I forgot to add: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%

### Day 91, September 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Exercise Tracker Microservice
Project after failing to get
razzle running on @glitch,
then stumbling over CRA
on it (kudos!) and playing
around with GatsbyJS on
@codesandboxapp : ).

And here it is on glitch: https://th-fcc-exercise.glitch.me/
Did I say, that I like async ... await functions?

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 1)

**Today's Progress (so far)**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"File Metadata Microservice"
Project and got me my
"APIs and Microservices Certificate",
that's makes it a triple : ).
As I needed less than half
an hour for it, that won't
be all for today, so stay tuned!

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 2)

**Today's (further) Progress**
As said before, while I did
@freeCodeCamp's MongoDB
challenges and projects,
I was a little annoyed at times
by warnings and errors with
outdated packages.
So I just opened my first PR to the Repo.
Wish me luck : ).

### Day 93, October 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Having coded nothing on the
weekend (needed a break after
last week % ), I jumped straight
back in and finally finished
@freeCodeCamp's "Heat Map" Project.
Afterwards finished the
"Choropleth Map", which seemed
easier than the first (except
D3.js v5 % ).

### Day 94, October 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
The last Project of @freeCodeCamp's
"Data Visualization Certification"
was harder than the one before
(too many examples still use D3.js v4
or even v3 - but I went with v5 % ).
But got me my certificate, that's
a quadruple now : ).

### Day 99, October 19, Friday

**Today's "Progress"**
1/3
Of course it was a bad idea
to get back into the challenge
after more than a 24h of
sleeplessness, but still managed
to finish @freeCodeCamp's
"Issue Tracker Project" in way
too much time: ~2h til the tests
were all showing green - but
wait for it:

2/3
Later over 4 more hours of
debugging caused by a switched
key / value pair -.-

And I didn't post any updates,
cause I was feeling under the
weather with partially self-imposed
ailment for the last week where
I just got to some reading and
too many thoughts and ideas...

3/3
...bad ones of both kind, I just
can't count for the challenge % |.

But on to a final sprint ^^!

On my last day of the Challenge
I binge-programmed through the

### Day 100 + 1 & 2, October 23, Tuesday & October 24, Wednesday

**Twoday's "Progress"**
Thnx for your kindness!
I completely forgot to tell you,
that I'm already in my penalty ^^.
Yesterday I did a PR to
"styled-media-queries", bumping
it to styled-components 4
and Babel 7. Today I wrote
the first tests in jest for it : ).
