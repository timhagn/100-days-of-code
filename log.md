Timestamp Microservice Project
as a cooldown... % )

Why do you want both a #github
repo and #glitch link _both_ to be
able to complete the Project oO?

### Day 89, September 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**
Couldn't code much today,
as a fruitful meeting with
my Designer-Wife @ninahagn
took place : ).
Then we resealed our windows,
temps are dropping -.-
But I at least finished
@freeCodeCamp's Header Parser
Microservice Project ; ).

### Day 90, September 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**
Went through the @freeCodeCamp
MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges,
but if I hadn't known #MongoDB
before, I might have been stumped.
Maybe should finally contribute % ).
Finished the URL Shortener
Microservice Project afterwards : ).

I used my URL shortener for the above link, but twitter linked through % ). Link on Glitch: https://th-fcc-su.glitch.me/  And I forgot to add: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%

### Day 91, September 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
Exercise Tracker Microservice
Project after failing to get
razzle running on @glitch,
then stumbling over CRA
on it (kudos!) and playing
around with GatsbyJS on
@codesandboxapp : ).

And here it is on glitch: https://th-fcc-exercise.glitch.me/
Did I say, that I like async ... await functions?

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 1)

**Today's Progress (so far)**
Finished @freeCodeCamp's
"File Metadata Microservice"
Project and got me my
"APIs and Microservices Certificate",
that's makes it a triple : ).
As I needed less than half
an hour for it, that won't
be all for today, so stay tuned!

### Day 92, September 28, Friday (part 2)

**Today's (further) Progress**
As said before, while I did
@freeCodeCamp's MongoDB
challenges and projects,
I was a little annoyed at times
by warnings and errors with
outdated packages.
So I just opened my first PR to the Repo.
Wish me luck : ).
