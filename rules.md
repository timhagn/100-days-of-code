# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days as long as
     my health allows - else I'll return on the next feasible day.*

#### Start Date
June 14th, 2018.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub so that anyone can see my progress. [TODO]
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges.
