# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
*I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days as long as
my health allows - else I'll return on the next feasible day.*

#### Start Date
June 14th, 2018.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) & [Short-log](r1-log.md) with the
   day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges.
